#  Ruby Basics
## Description
 This assigngment will walk you through several of the most used ruby types and get your familiar with the ruby syntax
 ## Objectives

### Learning Objectives
 Understand how to use documentation and send messages to objects in ruby
 ### Performance Objectives
  RubyDocs, the ruby binary, and irb
  ## Details

### Deliverables
 A repo containing a basics.rb file
 ### Requirements
  The file should run without any errors or warnings and should only print 'true'
  ### Easy Mode

### Normal Mode
 Only change the left hand side of each expression to make it true
 ### Hard Mode
  The way these questions are written reveals a lot of duplication. Add a `question` method that takes two arguments, the prompt for the question, and the body of the question. Use that method to 'DRY up' the quiz. Requirements from Normal Mode must continue to be met.
  ### Nightmare Mode
   Datastructures are awesome. Lets turn our list of questions into a single data structure and print out the answers by looping through them. Make sure each question is labeled with a number automatically. Requirements from Normal Mode must continue to be met.
   ### Notes
