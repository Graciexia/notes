#  Ruby Basics
## Description
 This assignment will walk you through several of the most-used Ruby types and help you get familiar with Ruby syntax.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives
 At the end of this assignment, you should understand how to use documentation and send messages to objects in Ruby.

### Performance Objectives
  RubyDocs, the Ruby binary, and irb.

## Details

### Deliverables
 A repo containing a basics.rb file.

### Requirements
  The file should run without any errors or warnings and should only print 'true'.

### Normal Mode
  Only change the left hand side of each expression to make it true.
### Hard Mode
  The way these questions are written reveals a lot of duplication. Add a `question` method that takes two arguments: the prompt for the question and the body of the question. Use that method to 'DRY up' the quiz. Requirements from Normal Mode must still be met.
### Nightmare Mode
   Data structures are awesome. Let's turn our list of questions into a single data structure and print the answers by looping through them. Make sure each question is labeled with a number automatically. Requirements from Normal Mode still must be met.

### Additional Resource
 `basics.rb` can be found and downloaded from [here](https://gist.github.com/jah2488/1be33c0b78269f97d908)
