## in class assignment time

I would like a Ruby program that
when run, it asks for my age.

It then tells me what I can do based on my age.

If I am younger than 18, I can do nothing.

If I am older than 18, I can vote (and smoke).

If I am older than 21, I can drink.

If I am older than 25, I can rent a car.


BONUS:
  Ask for my age in a loop so I can change my age after I have given it the first time.
  (Ask me if I want to try again)

  BONUS - BONUS:
    Use methods.
