##Designing a program or system
Designing any type of system or program is hard. Doing it without a gameplan is only going to make it harder. The following is a list of the steps I take before I actually start coding any problem. Think of it as a checklist.
*(All of these should be done on paper. I always find that works better than in a text doc on the computer)*
- **Identify and break down the problem into small tasks**: Created a list of everything that needs to be done for the problem to be complete. You can (and should) break any complex items down even further until each item in the list is a discrete, approachable problem that you know how to solve.
- **List program execution steps**: Unrelated to the last list, write down (in order) all the steps your program will go through before it is finished. Think of this as the flow of your app. (ex. Start | Ask for Age | Tell Age | Ask Again | Say Goodbye)
- **Identify Nouns and Verbs**: This is where you look for any Classes or Methods you may need. Remember that Classes are ususally nouns and Methods are usually actions or verbs. Write down each possible class with a few notes about why you think you'll need it and any properties or methods you think it may end up having.
- **Create Project Structure**: I find it much easier to think in my project with some basic scaffolding out of the way. Creating all the directories that I need helps me to focus.
- **Get my project on github**: I am awful at remembering to push code to github. Doing it first has helped me to not forget. Once your directory structure is setup. Create a git repo locally and then push to github once your remote is setup.


##Implementing programs or systems
Don't stare into the Abyss. Seriously, do not stare at the empty page, no good will come of it. Take a walk, take a shower, clear your head and come back to it. Don't dissappear for several hours, but give yourself a few mintues to keep your stress and frustration under control. Stress doesn't make anyone a better programmer.

So now that you've got all your documentation ready, you've got to start somewhere. You have a few options, you can start at the beginning of the program execution and build out each piece as you need it or you can build up the from the foundation everything you need and then use all the pieces at the end.

Once you've chosen a starting location, decide which task that means you are working on. If you don't think you know how to accomplish that, try breaking it down even smaller. (ex. To sum these ages I need to: get all the ages in a var, add all the ages together, done) If your problem is broken down small enough the tasks start to sound very generalized. This is good. When you've broken a task down from "Get the average day care child age in South Austin" to "Sum an array of numbers" you know you're at a good spot. Generalized tasks are much easier to find answers for on [google](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+sum+an+array+of+numbers+ruby)

Also: Don't give up!
